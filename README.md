# cla

A Rust implementation of `cal` with some extra features.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

I just started this project and if I follow through with it, the goal will be for `cla` to be a functioning TODO/Agenda system.

Right now, cloning and repo and running using `cargo run` will just print out a calendar just like calling `cal` with no arguments.
